# Snapchat-Lens-Scripts-Cheat

This repository contains a collection of scripts that can be used to create interactive and engaging Snapchat lenses. The scripts use various features of the Snapchat lens script language, such as face detection, object detection, animation, interaction, augmented reality, and more. The scripts range from simple overlays to more complex games and virtual try-on experiences.

All the scripts are well commented and organized to make it easy for developers to understand and use them. There are also examples of how to use the scripts to create different types of lenses.

You can use these scripts as a starting point to create your own lenses and customize them to suit your needs. The scripts can also be used as a reference to learn more about the Snapchat lens script language and its capabilities.

Please note that creating lenses requires a developer account with Snapchat and knowledge of programming. The scripts are provided as-is and may require additional modifications to work with your specific lens.

Feel free to use the scripts, modify them, and share your creations with the community. I can wait to see what you build!
